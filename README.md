# Amazing-controller-RCcar
In the dynamic landscape of automotive design, innovation is the driving force that propels the industry
forward. At the heart of this innovation is the quest for enhanced performance, efficiency, and safety. In
this context, the Electronic Differential plays a vital role in power distribution and traction control of
modern vehicles.
The challenge of this course is to improve the handling and performance of the RC model racing
car. This will be achieved by designing and implementing torque control for each of its rear wheels. To
accomplish this, a solid understanding of vehicle dynamics, including concepts like understeer, oversteer,
and dynamic weight transfer is required.
Initially, we will acquaint ourselves with the RC model car. After which, an examination of vehicle
dynamics modeling will be conducted utilizing a simplified bicycle model. This project will encompass two
pivotal control challenges: the management of yaw rate to achieve enhanced vehicle neutrality or controlled
oversteer, and the implementation of traction control mechanisms aimed at averting undue wheel slip.
The effectiveness of these solutions will be assessed through real-world experimentation, facilitated by the
utilization of Matlab/Simulink.
